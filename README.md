# Algorithms & Patterns

This repository contains my solution for some common algorithms and design patterns. I've created this repository to 
learn about algorithms or design patterns and improve solving different common computer science problems. 
I'll try to add more solutions if I have time :)

Each solved problem has a program written in Java. 

Algorithms
--------

### Sorting Algorithms

* [Selection] ()

* [Insertion] ()

* [Shell] ()

Design Patterns
--------

>'''
Each pattern describes a problem which occurs over and over again in our environment , and then describes the core of
the solution to that problem , in such a way that you can use this solution a million times over, without ever doing
it the same way twice
>'''

* [Iterator-迭代器模式](https://github.com/vikingden8/Algorithms-Patterns/blob/master/src/main/java/com/viking/patterns/Iterator.md)

* [Fail-Fast和Fail-Safe设计模式](http://vikingden.cn/2017/01/05/design-patterns-001-fast-fail-vs-fast-safe/)

* [单例模式](https://github.com/vikingden8/Algorithms-Patterns/blob/master/src/main/java/com/viking/patterns/singleton/Singleton.md)

Support
